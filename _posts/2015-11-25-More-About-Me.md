title: More About Me
---

After completing my Masters degree in 2014, I decided to take a break from formal education and explore areas of business related to my other major passions of Music and Technology. I began an internship with the classical musical publisher [Edition Peters](http://www.edition-peters.com/) in Old Street, London. 

This experience was instrumental in forming ideas about my future; I discovered what I enjoy and what I don't, what interests me and what doesn't. I gained experience in every department of the company, from musical engraving and score design to printing and accounts.

It was during this time that I had the fortune of being involved in an internal technology startup, which was creating a new app related to classical music publishing and consumption. For the first time in my life I was exposed to programming and I found it extremely interesting. I started doing basic HTML and CSS, teaching myself a small bit of Javascript in my spare time.

Most of all, this experience gave me a taste for the startup universe at large and led me on to co-founding a startup in January 2015. Given that neither the CEO or I had much experience in business we looked to the tried and tested Blue Ocean Strategy and The Startup Owners Manual. The information in those books served as a foundation to our approach.

As with most startups, we had an idea we thought huge and then continuously iterated upon it after talking to potential customers â€“ refining our idea into something we could build. This took us through multiple business model canvases and idea cycles, requiring us to be supremely agile and careful with what we were building. 

We found our original idea to be too broad, so we focused on one area of it. This then led to yet further focus and so on. Quite inevitably, after 7 or so months, I found that we had iterated into an area of business that I could no longer bring much value to. 

The refining process forced us to become more and more specialised, to the point where the market required a certain niche expertise that I didn't possess. So I parted ways with the startup, very proud of where we managed to get to. 

I learnt an extraordinary amount in such a small space of time, and feel very lucky that I was able to get this experience at the age of 23. Among the many things I learnt, the point perhaps most relevant to where I am now is the realisation that if I had more technical knowledge, I could actualize my ideas much quicker and at a much lesser cost by building it myself. 

I found first hand that without solid technical knowledge, the road to bringing one's product or service to the online market can become obscured and obviously also be hindered by development costs.

So, since June 2015 I have dedicated myself full time to learning everything I can about web development and computer science in general. Everything I know is self taught. I have overcome the lack of guidance by reading everything I can and simply building things - finding out what works and what doesn't.

My current areas of interest align me with the role of front-end developer, leaning more towards the programming side but still involving a large element of design. I particularly enjoy crafting minimal but immersive websites that leverage the latest technologies for fast performance and user experience.
