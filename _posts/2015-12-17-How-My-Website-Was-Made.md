title: How My Website Was Made
---
I have broken this down into three parts. 

* Part one covers the design process. 
* Part two covers the tools I used.
* Part three covers more technical details (like the scrolling animations) and goes through some of the many challenges I ran into, including how I overcame them.

This is part one which will cover the design process in building my home webpage:
### 1. Design

My main goal in design was to achieve a somewhat minimal, though animated, one-page scrolling website. 
The colour scheme started off as a simple light and dark theme, which later expanded to include more varied colours in both the choice of images and page body. 

For typography, I used Helvetica Neue for its simplicity and proven legibility on all devices. For the main headers, I decided on a large font with increased line-spacing but decreased font-weight, which maintains legibility and improves the aesthetics of the titles. I also made use of some JavaScript to justify certain headers across their containers, achieving the increased line spacing relative to the viewport size.

My brand logo is a simple heptagon (in SVG format for crisp, scalable greatness). The reason behind the heptagon, apart from its innate beauty, relates to a musical cryptography project I am working on that is based the heptagon. Perhaps I will write another post about it.

The structure of the page was in part motivated by what prospective clients or employers would want to see on the page and also let anyone interested knowing more about me and my skills. As such, the page is formed of 6 sections:

1. Landing area (home).
2. Portfolio.
3. About
4. Blog
5. Testimonials
6. Contact

I wanted the landing area to have minimal amounts of information but enough events of interest to encourage the user to scroll down or click on the call to action button, taking them to see my portfolio of work (the next section).

The portfolio section has just the title of the project, a brief explanation, a button to see live and an image masked with my heptagon brand logo. 

The about section has my picture as the background with short text about me and my skills. At this point, I want the user to feel like they are moving through a story, with more colours being used.

Next, a small section dedicated to testimonials harking back to the original light and dark theme.

Finally, for contrast, the contact section uses bright blues and purples in a linear-gradient, with a second call to action to get in contact with me to discuss a project. 

With this 6 section structure in place, I created the static mockup and then set about adding the scrolling animations and ensuring device compatibility.

The next section outlines the tools I used.
