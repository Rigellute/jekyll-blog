### Bio 
My name is Alexander Keliris and I am a freelance front-end web developer based in London and the South East of England.

I studied Philosophy at the University of Sheffield, originally with the intention of going on to do a Ph.D. and have a career as a professional Philosopher/Academic. However, after completing my Masters degree in 2014, I decided to take a break from formal education and explore areas of business related to my other major passions of Music and Technology. 

I now specialise in client-side Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Though I am also comfortable dipping into the back-end. I design/actualise website mockups quickly and accurately using the latest technologies, with obsessive focus on user experience. Thus, I find myself well suited to the roll of front end developer.
